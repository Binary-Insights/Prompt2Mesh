*Diffuse Characteristics:*
- **Roughness:** 0.8-0.9 (fairly matte base, before finish)
- **Color Temperature Shift:** Warm (2800-3200K reflected light)
  - Adds warmth to neutral light sources
  - Enhances warm light sources
- **Lambertian Response:** Primarily Lambertian (diffuse) with slight retro-reflection
- **Subsurface Component:** 15% of diffuse light penetrates surface (see SSS section)

---

**Specular Reflection Properties:**

- **Highlight Shape:** Elongated ellipse following wood grain direction
- **Aspect Ratio:** 3:1 (length parallel to grain : width perpendicular to grain)
- **Peak Intensity:** 35% of incoming light (0.35 specular value)
- **Falloff Profile:** Gradual with soft edges
  - Distribution: GGX or Beckmann (physically accurate)
  - Roughness: 0.25 (satin finish)
- **Size Variation:** Highlight size increases at grazing angles (Fresnel effect)
- **Color Tint:** Slight warm tint matching wood undertone

*On Cylindrical Leg Surfaces:*

### Material Shader Setup (Technical)

**Blender Principled BSDF Configuration:**

*Base Color:*
```
- Input: Wood texture (procedural or image-based)
- Base RGB: (194, 149, 103) / Hex #C29567
- Adjustments:
  • Add ColorRamp node for contrast/variation control
  • Multiply with Ambient Occlusion (factor: 0.7) for depth
  • Add slight HSV adjustment for warmth (+5° hue, +10% saturation)
```

*Subsurface Scattering:*
```
- Subsurface: 0.15
- Subsurface Radius: RGB(2.0, 1.0, 0.5) mm
- Subsurface Color: RGB(255, 220, 180) / Hex #FFDCB4
- Subsurface Method: Random Walk (more accurate for wood)
- Subsurface IOR: 1.52 (matches clearcoat)
```

*Specular Settings:*
```
- Specular: 0.5 (moderate reflectivity)
- Roughness: 0.25 (satin finish)
  • Map with texture for variation (0.20-0.30 range)
  • Earlywood slightly rougher, latewood slightly smoother
- Anisotropic: 0.15 (elongates highlights along grain)
- Anisotropic Rotation: 
  • Connect to grain direction map (0.0 = along length)
  • Use texture or procedural for wood grain flow
- Sheen: 0.1 (subtle fabric-like edge glow)
- Sheen Tint: 0.3 (warm tint matching wood)
```

*Clearcoat (Polyurethane Finish Layer):*
```
- Clearcoat: 0.3 (moderate clear layer)
- Clearcoat Roughness: 0.15 (slightly smoother than base)
- Clearcoat Normal: Connect subtle normal map (strength: 0.1)
  • Represents finish texture/orange peel
- Effect: Creates separate specular layer above wood
```

*Normal and Bump Mapping:*
```
- Normal Map:
  • Strength: 0.3
  • Purpose: Wood grain relief (growth ring ridges)
  • Source: Procedural noise or texture map
  
- Bump Map:
  • Strength: 0.1
  • Distance: 0.001 (subtle micro-texture)
  • Purpose: Fine surface texture, pores
  
- Combination:
  • Use Normal Map node to combine both
  • Normal map for macro detail (grain)
  • Bump for micro detail (texture)
```

*Texture Coordinate Mapping:*
```
- Use UV mapping for tabletop planks
- Use Generated or Object coordinates for legs
- Apply separate mapping for each component
- Align grain direction properly:
  • Tabletop: Along 72-inch length
  • Apron: Along apron length
  • Legs: Vertical (up-down)
```

**Procedural Wood Shader Approach (Alternative to Image Textures):**

*Advantages:*
- Infinite resolution (no pixelation)
- Full control over grain characteristics
- No UV unwrapping required for simple shapes
- Easier to adjust color, scale, variation

*Basic Node Setup:*

1. **Grain Pattern (Wave Texture):**
   ```
   - Wave Texture node:
     • Type: Bands
     • Scale: 15-20 (controls ring spacing)
     • Distortion: 0.5-1.0 (creates natural variation)
     • Detail: 2-3 (adds complexity)
   - ColorRamp for contrast control
   ```

2. **Ray Fleck Pattern (Voronoi Texture):**
   ```
   - Voronoi Texture:
     • Feature: F1
     • Scale: 50-80
     • Randomness: 0.8
   - ColorRamp to isolate flecks (narrow band)
   - Mix with base grain (Add or Overlay)
   ```

3. **Color Variation (Noise Texture):**
   ```
   - Noise Texture:
     • Scale: 3-5 (large-scale variation)
     • Detail: 2
   - ColorRamp to control range
   - Mix with base color (Multiply or Overlay, factor: 0.15)
   ```

4. **Combining Textures:**
   ```
   - Mix grain, flecks, and color variation
   - Use different mix modes for each layer
   - Final result → Base Color input
   ```

```

---

**Random Element Distribution (Avoid Patterns):**

*Knot Placement (If Included):*
```
Avoid:
  - Symmetrical placement
  - Even spacing
  - Pattern or grid arrangement
  - Same size knots

Instead:
  - Random position within each plank
  - Varying sizes (0.25-1 inch)

Instead:
  - Use different procedural noise seeds for each plank
  - Rotate and offset textures randomly
  - Vary grain scale by ±10-15% per plank
  - Ensure each plank has unique character

Implementation:
  - Separate material for each plank, or
  - Use Object coordinates with random offset per plank, or
  - Use UV mapping with unique texture per plank
```

*Ray Fleck Distribution:*
```
Avoid:
  - Grid pattern

  - Symmetry

Instead:
  - Truly random placement
  - Clustered in some areas, sparse in others
  - Varying sizes (0.125-0.75 inches)
  - Different orientations (±15° from perpendicular)

Implementation:
  - Use Voronoi or random scatter

   - Generous dimensions for family dining
   - Balanced visual weight between top and base

2. **Natural Wood Character**
   - Embrace grain variation and subtle imperfections
   - Showcase quarter-sawn oak's distinctive ray flecks
   - Allow natural color variation between planks
   - Avoid overly perfect, artificial uniformity

3. **Quality Joinery**
   - Tight-fitting mortise and tenon joints
   - Minimal visible gaps (0.03125 inches)
   - Traditional construction methods
   - Corner reinforcement (hidden but implied)

4. **Satin Finish**

**Phase 3: Fine Details**
```
13. Add micro-chamfers to sharp edges (0.03125 inches)
14. Model joint seam lines (very subtle)
15. Add slight surface undulation (hand-planed appearance)
16. Create subtle imperfections (optional: dings, wear)
17. Ensure no perfectly straight edges (slight variation)
```

**Phase 4: Subdivision and Smoothing**
```
18. Apply Subdivision Surface modifiers where needed
   - Legs: Level 2-3 for smooth curves
   - Decorative elements: Level 2-3 for clean profiles
   - Tabletop: Level 1-2 or none (mostly flat)
19. Add Edge Creases to maintain sharp edges where desired
20. Check for artifacts and adjust topology
```

### Texturing Workflow Recommendations

**Approach 1: Procedural Shader (Recommended)**
```
Advantages:
- Infinite resolution
- Full control over parameters
- Easy to adjust
- No UV unwrapping for simple shapes

Process:
1. Create base wood color (ColorRamp from RGB values)
2. Add grain pattern (Wave Texture, distorted)
3. Add ray flecks (Voronoi Texture, masked)
4. Add color variation (Noise Texture, subtle)
5. Combine layers with Mix nodes
6. Connect to Principled BSDF Base Color
7. Add normal map (procedural bump for grain relief)
8. Set up SSS, specular, anisotropic, clearcoat
9. Test render and adjust
```

**Approach 2: Image Textures**
```
Advantages:
- Photorealistic grain patterns
- Can use scanned real wood
- Predictable results

Process:
1. UV unwrap all components
   - Tabletop: Planar projection from top
   - Legs: Cylindrical projection
   - Aprons: Planar projection from outside
2. Acquire or create seamless wood textures
   - Diffuse/albedo map
   - Normal map
   - Roughness map
   - Optional: Displacement map
3. Apply textures to UV-mapped surfaces
4. Align grain direction properly
5. Set up Principled BSDF with texture maps
6. Add SSS, specular, clearcoat settings
7. Test render and adjust
```

**Key Texture Settings (Either Approach):**
```
- Base Color: RGB(194, 149, 103) as starting point
- Subsurface: 0.15, radius RGB(2.0, 1.0, 0.5)mm
- Specular: 0.5, Roughness: 0.25
- Anisotropic: 0.15 (following grain)
- Clearcoat: 0.3, Clearcoat Roughness: 0.15
- Normal/Bump: Subtle (0.3 strength for normal, 0.1 for bump)
```

### Lighting Setup Recommendations

**Standard Product Lighting (Recommended Starting Point):**
```
1. Key Light:
   - Type: Area Light (2×2 feet)
   - Position: 45° front-right, 45° elevation
   - Intensity: 100W equivalent
   - Color: 5200K (neutral daylight)

2. Fill Light:
   - Type: Area Light (4×4 feet)
   - Position: 90° left, 30° elevation
   - Intensity: 35W equivalent
   - Color: 4800K (slightly warm)

3. Rim Light:
   - Type: Area Light (1.5×1.5 feet)
   - Position: 135° behind-left, 60° elevation
   - Intensity: 120W equivalent
   - Color: 6000K (slightly cool)

4. Environment:
   - Type: HDRI (studio or interior)
   - Intensity: 25% of key light
   - Rotation: Align with key light direction
```

**Quick Test Lighting (For Fast Previews):**
```
- Single large area light above and in front
- HDRI environment at 50% strength
- Adjust exposure in camera settings
- Sufficient for material/model testing
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Modeling:**
- ❌ Perfectly uniform planks (too artificial)
- ❌ Identical legs (cloned appearance)
- ❌ Sharp edges everywhere (unrealistic, catches light wrong)
- ❌ Perfectly flat tabletop (too CG, add subtle undulation)
- ❌ No joint seam lines (looks like one piece, not assembled)

**Texturing:**
- ❌ Repeating texture patterns (use random offsets)
- ❌ Too much contrast in grain (overpowering)
- ❌ Too little variation (boring, flat)
- ❌ Wrong grain direction (must follow length)
- ❌ No subsurface scattering (wood looks dead/plastic)
- ❌ Wrong roughness (too shiny = plastic, too matte = chalk)

**Lighting:**
- ❌ Single hard light (harsh shadows, no depth)
- ❌ Too much ambient light (flat, no shadows)
- ❌ Wrong color temperature (too cool = sterile, too warm = orange)
- ❌ No rim/back light (blends into background)
- ❌ Overlighting (washed out, no depth)

**Rendering:**
- ❌ Too few samples (noisy, grainy)
- ❌ Too few light bounces (dark, inaccurate SSS)
- ❌ Wrong color management (incorrect colors)
- ❌ No depth of field (too sharp, unrealistic)
- ❌ Overusing denoising (loses detail)

### Optimization Tips

**For Faster Viewport Performance:**
```
- Use lower subdivision levels in viewport
- Disable SSS in viewport (enable for renders only)
- Use simplified shader for viewport (just base color)
- Hide objects not in current view
- Use bounding box display for complex objects
```

**For Faster Render Times:**
```
- Use adaptive sampling (stops when clean)
- Enable denoising (allows fewer samples)
- Use GPU rendering if available (much faster)
- Reduce light bounces if possible (test 8 vs 12)
- Use render region for test renders (small area)
- Render lower resolution for tests (50% size)
```

**For Smaller File Sizes:**
```
- Use procedural textures instead of large images
- If using images, compress appropriately (PNG or JPEG)
- Remove unused materials and textures
- Pack external files into .blend file
- Use instances for repeated elements (legs, if identical)
```

### Variations to Consider

**Design Variations:**
```
- Different wood species (walnut, cherry, maple)
  • Adjust colors, grain pattern, ray fleck prominence
  
- Different sizes (48×30, 60×36, 84×42 inches)
  • Scale proportionally, maintain ratios
  
- Different leg styles (square tapered, turned ball feet)
  • Maintain overall proportions and design language
  
- Different edge profiles (bullnose, ogee, straight)
  • Adjust chamfer/roundover details
  
- Different finishes (oil, wax, lacquer)
  • Adjust specular roughness and clearcoat
```

**Scene Variations:**
```
- Different lighting scenarios (window light, studio, dramatic)
- Different camera angles (overhead, low angle, detail shots)
- With place settings (plates, glasses, centerpiece)
- In different environments (dining room, studio, outdoor)
- Different times of day (morning light, evening glow)
```

### Final Notes

This description provides comprehensive information for creating a **photorealistic 3D model** of a traditional dining table. The level of detail allows for:

- **Accurate modeling** of all components and features
- **Realistic materials** with proper physical properties
- **Convincing lighting** that showcases the wood's beauty
- **Natural imperfections** that prevent "CG" appearance
- **Flexibility** to adjust and customize as needed

**Remember:**
- **Less is often more** - subtle details are more convincing than exaggerated ones
- **Observe real furniture** - reference photos help immensely
- **Test frequently** - render small sections to verify materials and lighting
- **Iterate and refine** - first attempt rarely perfect, adjust based on results
- **Trust your eye** - if something looks wrong, it probably is

**The goal is photorealism with character** - a table that looks like it could exist in the real world, with all the subtle variations and imperfections that make real objects interesting and believable.

Good luck with your model! 🪵✨
