- **Rear Setback:** 10 feet (3.05m) - provides private outdoor space and code compliance

**Urban Density Strategies:**
- **Vertical Organization:** Three floors maximize livable area on constrained footprint
- **Efficient Circulation:** Compact stair placement (not detailed but space allocated)
- **Minimal Setbacks:** Building positioned close to property lines
- **Shared Walls:** Side walls designed as potential party walls (firewall construction)

**Street Interface:**
- **Sidewalk Connection:** Direct walkway from public sidewalk to entrance
- **Semi-Private Zone:** 8-foot front yard creates buffer between public and private
- **Street Presence:** Facade composition designed for pedestrian-scale viewing

- **Side-Mounted Utilities:** Meters and equipment on less-visible side walls
- **Underground Services:** All utilities enter below grade (electric, water, gas, sewer)
- **Waste Management:** Space allocated at rear for bins (not modeled)

### Technical Modeling Considerations

**Blender-Specific Guidance:**

**Unit Setup:**
- Set Blender units to Metric
- Use 1 Blender unit = 1 meter for accuracy
- Enable "Scene Units" in properties panel
- Convert all imperial measurements: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters

**Modeling Approach:**
1. **Foundation and Base:**
   - Start with cube, scale to foundation dimensions
   - Extrude upward for walls
   - Use Array modifier for brick courses
   - Boolean operations for window and door openings

2. **Wall Construction:**
   - Model walls as solid volumes (10-inch/25.4cm thickness)
   - Create separate objects for different materials (brick sections, cement board sections)
   - Use Edge Split modifier for crisp corners
   - Apply Bevel modifier (0.5mm) to edges for realism

3. **Windows and Doors:**
   - Model frames with actual depth (4 inches/10cm)
   - Glass as separate objects with thickness (0.25 inches/0.6cm)
   - Use Array modifier for multi-pane windows
   - Ensure proper clearance for Boolean operations (0.5mm minimum)

4. **Roof Structure:**
   - Model as separate mesh from walls
   - Use Solidify modifier for membrane thickness
   - Create parapet as extruded edge loop
   - Add Edge Crease for sharp parapet edges

**Boolean Operation Tips:**
- Always apply scale (Ctrl+A) before Boolean operations
- Use "Fast" solver for simple cuts, "Exact" for complex
- Minimum wall thickness between openings: 12 inches (30.5cm)
- Add 1mm tolerance to cutting objects to prevent Z-fighting

**Material Assignment:**
- Use material slots for different surfaces on same object
- Assign materials in Edit mode by selecting faces
- Use UV unwrapping for brick texture alignment
- Apply Box projection for cement board panels

**Texture Mapping:**
- **Brick:** Use UV Project modifier with camera for correct running bond
- **Cement Board:** Box mapping with 4×8 foot (1.22×2.44m) texture scale
- **Windows:** Planar mapping for glass, box for frames
- **Roof:** Top-down planar projection

**Optimization:**
- Use instances for repeated elements (windows, bricks in close-ups)
- Apply modifiers before final render
- Use Level of Detail (LOD) for distant views
- Merge vertices by distance (0.1mm threshold) to clean geometry

**Lighting Preparation:**
- Model interior window reveals (4-inch/10cm depth minimum)
- Create light-catching surfaces (sills, overhangs)
- Ensure normals face correctly (Shift+N to recalculate)
- Add slight surface imperfections for realistic light interaction

**Camera Considerations:**
- Typical viewing distance: 30-50 feet (9-15m) for exterior shots
- Eye height: 5.5 feet (1.68m) for pedestrian views
- Use 35mm focal length for realistic architectural perspective
- Enable camera DOF with f/5.6 for slight background blur

**Render Settings Recommendations:**
- Cycles render engine for photorealism
- Samples: 512-1024 for final renders
- Light bounces: 8 maximum, 4 minimum
- Use HDRI environment for realistic lighting
- Enable Ambient Occlusion in render settings

### Lighting Considerations

**Natural Light Interaction:**

**Facade Shadow Patterns:**
- **Recessed Entry:** Creates 4-foot deep shadow volume, strongest at midday
- **Portico Overhang:** Casts 3-foot shadow on facade, varies with sun angle
- **Window Reveals:** 4-inch depth creates subtle shadow frames around glazing
- **Parapet Shadow:** Projects 30-inch shadow on upper facade in morning/evening

**Material Light Response:**
- **Brick:** Diffuse reflection, slight subsurface scattering for depth
- **Cement Board:** Clean reflections, subtle specularity creates slight sheen
- **Glass:** Primary light transmission (95%), secondary reflections (40% at angles)
- **Metal Elements:** Crisp highlights on brushed surfaces, matte absorption on powder-coat

**Time-of-Day Variations:**
- **Morning (East Light):** Side windows receive direct light, front facade in shadow
- **Midday (Overhead):** Strong shadows from portico and parapet, high contrast
- **Afternoon (West Light):** Front facade fully illuminated, long shadows from vertical elements
- **Evening (Low Angle):** Dramatic raking light emphasizes texture, warm color temperature

**Artificial Lighting:**

**Exterior Fixtures:**
- **Wall Sconces (flanking door):**
  - Output: Up and down beams, 90-degree spread
  - Intensity: 500 lumens equivalent per fixture
  - Color Temperature: 3000K (warm white)
  - Effect: Grazing light on brick, illuminated entry

- **Portico LED Strip:**
  - Output: Downward wash, 120-degree spread
  - Intensity: 800 lumens equivalent total
  - Color Temperature: 4000K (neutral white)
  - Effect: Even illumination of entry area, welcoming glow

- **Step Lighting (optional detail):**
  - Location: Recessed in step risers
  - Output: Forward wash on treads
  - Intensity: 50 lumens per step
  - Color Temperature: 3000K

**Interior Light Bleed:**
- Window glow from interior lighting creates depth
- Warm interior light (2700K) contrasts with exterior
- Ground floor: 60% light transmission through curtains/blinds
- Upper floors: 80% transmission (less privacy screening)

**Environmental Lighting:**

**HDRI Setup Recommendations:**
- **Urban Environment:** City HDRI with buildings for realistic reflections in glass
- **Time Setting:** Late afternoon (4-6 PM) for warm, dramatic light
- **Intensity:** 1.0-1.5 for natural brightness
- **Rotation:** Adjust to place sun at 45-degree angle to front facade

**Supplemental Lighting:**
- **Sun Lamp:** 
  - Strength: 5.0
  - Angle: 45 degrees horizontal, 30 degrees vertical
  - Color Temperature: 5500K (daylight)
  
- **Sky Ambient:**
  - Strength: 0.3-0.5
  - Color: Slight blue tint RGB (220, 230, 255)

- **Bounce Light (Ground Plane):**
  - Emission shader on ground: 0.2 strength
  - Simulates light reflection from pavement/ground

**Atmospheric Effects:**
- **Volumetric Lighting:** Subtle atmosphere volume (density 0.01) for light shafts through windows
- **Mist/Fog:** Optional light fog (density 0.005) for depth in wide shots
- **Glare:** Slight glare on glass reflections for realism (Glare node, threshold 0.8)

**Shadow Quality:**
- Enable contact shadows for crisp detail near surfaces
- Use high shadow samples (64+) for smooth penumbra
- Adjust shadow bias to prevent artifacts on thin geometry

**Reflection Strategy:**
- **Glass Windows:** Primary environment reflections, capture sky and surrounding buildings
- **Metal Elements:** Sharp reflections of nearby geometry, use Reflection Planes for efficiency
- **Glossy Surfaces:** Blurred reflections on cement board and door finish

This comprehensive description provides all necessary information to create a detailed, realistic urban house model in Blender. The specifications cover geometry, materials, architectural authenticity, and rendering considerations suitable for architectural visualization, game environment assets, urban planning presentations, or design portfolio pieces. All dimensions are construction-accurate and follow building codes, while modeling techniques are optimized for Blender's workflow and rendering capabilities.

REASONING STEPS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Analysis: # 3D Model Request Analysis

## Primary Object
**Urban House** - A residential building designed for city/urban environments

## Specific Details Mentioned
- Style: Urban/City architecture
- Software: Blender (specified tool)
- Type: House (residential structure)

## Key Characteristics to Consider
- Urban context suggests:
  - Multi-story structure (likely 2-3 floors)
  - Compact footprint
  - Modern or contemporary styling
  - Possible attached/row house configuration
  - Urban materials (brick, concrete, glass)

## Complexity Assessment
**Medium Complexity**

**Reasoning:**
- Architectural modeling requires multiple components (walls, windows, doors, roof)
- Urban houses typically have moderate geometric detail
- Requires basic to intermediate Blender skills
- Involves multiple materials and textures
- May include exterior details (stairs, railings, small yard elements)

## Recommended Approach
1. Start with basic box modeling for main structure
2. Add architectural details (windows, doors, trim)
3. Model roof structure
4. Add urban-specific elements (front steps, small fence/gate)
5. Apply materials and textures
6. Consider basic surrounding context (sidewalk, small yard)

**Estimated Modeling Time:** 4-8 hours depending on detail level

2. Assessment: NEEDS_EXPANSION - 0/6 criteria met

**Analysis:**
The prompt "Design a urban house using blender" fails to meet the detailed criteria:

1. ❌ **Dimensions/sizes** - No measurements specified
2. ❌ **Materials** - No material descriptions (brick, concrete, wood, etc.)
3. ❌ **Textures** - No texture details mentioned
4. ❌ **Colors** - No color specifications
5. ❌ **Structural components** - No specific architectural elements listed (floors, windows, doors, balconies, etc.)
6. ❌ **Surface features** - No details about exterior features or architectural style details

This is a basic request that only specifies:
- Object type (house)
- General style (urban)
- Software (Blender)

**What's missing for a detailed prompt:**
- How many stories? (2-story, 3-story)
- Dimensions? (e.g., "20 feet wide, 30 feet deep, 25 feet tall")
- Architectural style? (modern, brownstone, row house, contemporary)
- Materials? (red brick facade, concrete foundation, glass windows)
- Specific features? (front porch, balcony, flat roof, sloped roof, garage)
- Window/door specifications? (number, style, placement)
- Color scheme? (exterior colors, trim colors)

**Verdict:** This prompt requires significant expansion to be considered detailed.
