## 6. Lighting and Rendering Considerations

### **Tabletop Lighting Behavior:**

**Direct Lighting Response:**
- **Specular Highlights:** Soft, elongated highlights due to satin polyurethane finish
  - Highlight shape: Stretched and diffused, not pinpoint sharp
  - Highlight intensity: 20-30% of light source brightness
  - Falloff: Gradual with soft edges (Gaussian distribution)
  
- **Diffuse Reflection:** 
  - Primary lighting response is diffuse scattering
  - Wood grain becomes more visible and pronounced under direct light
  - Natural color variation enhanced by directional lighting
  - Darker areas (knots, heartwood) absorb more light
  
- **Subsurface Scattering:** 
  - Visible in thin areas and edges when backlit
  - Scattering radius: 1.5mm (0.059 inch)
  - Scattering color: Warm orange-yellow (RGB: R: 220, G: 190, B: 140)
  - Creates warm glow effect around perimeter when edge-lit
  - Most prominent on chamfered edges

**Indirect Lighting Response:**
- **Ambient Occlusion:** 
  - Strong AO in mounting plate recesses (darkening 40-60%)
  - Subtle AO where tabletop meets legs
  - Contact shadows in grain pores and knots
  
- **Light Bouncing:**
  - Warm color bounce from wood surface (orange-yellow cast)
  - Contributes warm ambient light to scene
  - Underside reflects less light (1-2 stops darker than top)
  
- **Shadow Reception:**
  - Soft shadow edges due to matte surface
  - Shadows slightly colored by wood tone (warm brown tint)
  - Edge chamfer creates subtle highlight line along perimeter

- **Light Bouncing:**
  - Minimal light bounce contribution due to dark, matte surface
  - Absorbs most incident light rather than reflecting
  - Does not significantly illuminate surrounding surfaces
  
- **Shadow Casting:**
  - Clean, defined shadow edges due to cylindrical form
  - Shadow sharpness depends on light source size
  - Groove creates thin secondary shadow line within leg shadow

- **Color Temperature Variation:** Slightly warm key light creates inviting atmosphere

### **Shadow Behavior Details:**

**Tabletop Shadows:**
- **Cast Shadows:** Soft-edged due to matte surface and large light sources
- **Self-Shadowing:** Hard-edged shadows in mounting plate recesses (small cavity)
- **Leg Shadows on Underside:** Soft transitional shadows where legs meet tabletop
- **Shadow Color:** Slightly warm brown tint from wood color influence
- **Transparency:** Opaque shadows (no light transmission through 1.5-inch thick top)

**Leg Shadows:**
- **Cast Shadows on Floor:** 
  - Clean, defined edges due to cylindrical form
  - Sharpness depends on light source size (softer with larger lights)
  - Length varies with light angle
  
- **Groove Shadow:** 
  - Thin, sharp shadow line around circumference
  - Depth creates strong local contrast
  - Always visible regardless of primary lighting direction
  
- **Contact Shadows:** 
  - Darkest at floor contact point
  - Gradual softening moving away from contact
  - Ambient occlusion enhances contact shadow depth

**Hardware Shadows:**
- **Screw Head Shadows:** 
  - Sharp, small circular shadows in mounting plates
  - Minimal contribution to overall appearance
  
- **Foot Pad Shadows:** 
  - Blend with leg shadows
  - Subtle edge shadow from foot pad perimeter
  - Contact shadow at floor interface

### **Advanced Rendering Techniques:**

**Subsurface Scattering Setup (for Wood):**
- **Method:** Christensen-Burley or Random Walk SSS
- **Scale:** 1.5mm (0.059 inch)
- **Radius RGB:** (1.5, 1.0, 0.5) mm for realistic color-dependent scattering
  - Red scatters furthest (warm glow)
  - Blue scatters least (cooler appearance)
- **IOR:** 1.45 (matches polyurethane coating)
- **Texture Influence:** Use wood density map to vary SSS intensity

**Normal Mapping Strategy:**
- **Wood Grain Normal Map:**

  - Strength: 0.4-0.6 (more pronounced)
  - Directional (anisotropic) scratches

**Displacement Mapping (Optional for Extreme Close-ups):**
- **Wood Surface:** 
  - Displacement: 0.5-1.0mm maximum
  - Captures deep grain pores and knot depth
  - Requires high geometry subdivision
  
- **Not Recommended for:** Metal or powder coat surfaces (normal maps sufficient)

**Camera and Depth of Field:**
- **Recommended Focal Length:** 50-85mm (realistic perspective, minimal distortion)
- **Aperture (f-stop):** f/4-f/8 for moderate depth of field
- **Focus Point:** Center of table or key design feature

Noise Texture → ColorRamp → Mix with base color (5-10% strength for variation)
Value (0.3-0.4) → Specular
Value (1.45) → IOR
Value (0.3) → Anisotropic
Image Texture (Wood Grain Direction) → Anisotropic Rotation
Value (0.1-0.2) → Subsurface
Color (RGB: 220, 190, 140) → Subsurface Color
Vector (1.5, 1.0, 0.5 mm) → Subsurface Radius
```

**Leg Powder Coat Shader (Principled BSDF):**
```
Color (RGB: 45, 45, 48) → Base Color
Noise Texture (small scale) → Normal Map → Normal (strength 0.1-0.2) [orange-peel texture]
Value (0.90-0.95) → Roughness
Value (0.1-0.15) → Specular
```

**Metal Brushed Shader (Principled BSDF):**
```
Color (RGB: 192, 192, 192) → Base Color
Value (1.0) → Metallic
Value (0.35-0.45) → Roughness
Value (0.75-0.85) → Anisotropic
Texture Coordinate (UV) → Radial gradient → Anisotropic Rotation
Image Texture (Brushed Metal Normal, 2K) → Normal Map → Normal (strength 0.4-0.6)
```

**Rubber Bumper Shader (Principled BSDF):**
```
Color (RGB: 20, 20, 20) → Base Color
Value (1.0) → Roughness

- Framing: Include full table with minimal cropping

### **Texture Resolution Recommendations:**

- **Wood Color Map:** 4K (4096 × 4096) - High detail needed
- **Wood Normal Map:** 2K-4K (2048-4096) - Important for grain relief
- **Wood Roughness Map:** 2K (2048 × 2048) - Sufficient detail
- **Metal Brushed Normal:** 2K (2048 × 2048) - Captures brush lines
- **Powder Coat Normal:** 1K-2K (1024-2048) - Subtle texture
- **Procedural Noise:** Generated at render time (no texture file)

### **Performance Optimization:**

- Use lower subdivision levels during modeling and viewport preview
- Enable Simplify in render settings during test renders
- Use lower sampling for viewport renders
- Disable depth of field during modeling
- Use holdout objects to mask unnecessary background geometry
- Instance legs using Array modifier (reduces memory)
- Use texture compression for large texture files

### **Export Considerations:**

If exporting for other applications:
- Apply all modifiers before export
- Ensure proper scale (1 Blender unit = 1 meter recommended)
- Bake complex procedural textures to image textures
- Include material names and proper UV maps
- Export as FBX or OBJ with materials
- Include separate texture files in export folder
