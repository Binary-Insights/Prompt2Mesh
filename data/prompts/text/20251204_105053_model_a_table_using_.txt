- **Metallic:** 0.0 (wood is non-metallic)
- **Specular:** 0.5 (default, appropriate for polyurethane)
- **Roughness:** 0.4-0.5 (matte finish, not glossy)
- **Specular Tint:** 0.0 (neutral reflections)
- **Anisotropic:** 0.3 (elongated reflections following grain)
- **Anisotropic Rotation:** Driven by grain direction map (0° or 90° depending on grain orientation)
- **Sheen:** 0.1-0.2 (subtle fabric-like sheen at grazing angles)
- **Sheen Tint:** 0.5 (neutral to warm)
- **Clearcoat:** 0.3 (simulates polyurethane coating)
- **Clearcoat Roughness:** 0.2 (slightly glossier than base)
- **IOR (Index of Refraction):** 1.45 (polyurethane coating)

**Subsurface Scattering (SSS):**
- **Subsurface Weight:** 0.05-0.08 (subtle translucency, visible at edges)
- **Subsurface Radius:** RGB (2.0, 1.5, 1.0) - warm wood tones, red penetrates deepest
- **Subsurface Scale:** 0.01 (controls depth of light penetration)
- **Subsurface IOR:** 1.45 (matches clearcoat)
- **Effect visibility:** Most prominent at edges (1.5" thickness) and thin sections
- **Backlighting response:** Creates warm glow when strongly backlit
- **Realism impact:** Critical for preventing "plastic" appearance

**Texture Mapping Strategy:**
- **Bump Map:** 0.01-0.02" depth, follows grain pattern (creates tactile grain feel)
- **Normal Map:** 0.002-0.005" fine grain detail (adds micro-surface variation)
- **Displacement Map (optional):** 0.005" maximum for ultra-realistic grain (computationally expensive)
- **Roughness Map:** Varies 0.35-0.5 along grain (smoother in valleys, rougher on peaks)
- **Color Variation Map:** ±5% RGB variation for natural wood color shifts
- **Anisotropic Rotation Map:** Black-to-white gradient controlling grain direction (0° to 90°)

**Fresnel Effect:**
- **Enabled:** Yes (automatic in Principled BSDF with IOR setting)
- **Impact:** Increases reflectivity at grazing angles (edge of table appears glossier)
- **Realism:** Essential for natural material appearance
- **IOR value:** 1.45 (polyurethane) creates appropriate Fresnel curve

### Leg Light Interaction:

**Metal Surface Properties (Blender Principled BSDF values):**
- **Base Color:** RGB (25, 25, 25) - true matte black
- **Metallic:** 1.0 (full metallic for accurate metal response)

- **Noise Scale:** 0.1 (fine texture, not coarse)
- **Pattern Type:** Random noise or cellular (simulates powder coat texture)
- **Effect:** Breaks up reflections, prevents CG "perfect" appearance
- **Roughness Variation:** ±0.05 variation in roughness map (subtle texture variation)

**Color and Tone:**
- **Base black:** RGB (25, 25, 25) - not pure black (0, 0, 0)
- **Slight warmth:** Can add +2-3 to red channel for subtle warm cast
- **Consistency:** Uniform color across all legs (quality powder coat)
- **No color shift:** Maintains true black under various lighting (unlike paint)

### Apron Light Interaction:

**Properties (matches tabletop):**
- All settings identical to tabletop for material consistency
- Grain direction rotated 90° on perpendicular aprons
- Slightly lighter base color: RGB (190, 160, 130) vs tabletop (180, 150, 120)
- Same roughness, SSS, and bump settings as tabletop

### Shadow Behavior:

**Tabletop Shadows:**
- **Shadow softness:** Soft shadows due to matte finish and diffuse surface
- **Shadow terminator:** Gradual transition, 3-4" from hard edge to full shadow (depends on light size)
- **Self-shadowing:** Grain valleys create subtle shadows, 10-20% darker than peaks
- **Edge shadows:** Slightly harder than surface shadows due to chamfer creating defined edge
- **Contact shadows:** Darkest where tabletop meets apron, 60-80% black
- **Ambient occlusion:** Corners and recesses 30-40% darker (use AO shader for realism)

**Leg Shadows:**
- **Shadow type:** Moderate softness (between hard and very soft)
- **Cylindrical gradient:** Shadow wraps around leg form, creating gradient from light to dark side
- **Contact shadows:** Floor contact point darkest, 80-90% black
- **Shadow falloff:** Exponential decay, reaching 50% darkness at 2" from leg base
- **Multiple legs:** Overlapping shadows create darker areas where shadows intersect
- **Shadow color:** Slightly warm black, not pure neutral (reflects environment)

**Apron Shadows:**
- **Horizontal shadow line:** Cast onto legs, defines apron depth
- **Shadow depth:** 0.125" (matches apron setback from leg surface)
- **Corner shadows:** Ambient occlusion in leg-apron-leg corners, 40-50% darker
- **Underside shadow:** Apron bottom casts shadow on legs below, soft gradient
- **Interior shadows:** Between aprons under table, creates darker interior zone

**Shadow Interaction:**
- **Overlapping shadows:** Multiple light sources create layered shadows (more realistic)
- **Colored shadows:** Environment reflections tint shadows subtly (not pure black)
- **Shadow sharpness:** Varies with light source distance and size
- **Ground plane:** Table casts shadow on floor, size depends on light height and angle

## Blender-Specific Modeling Notes:

### Recommended Modeling Workflow:

**Phase 1: Basic Geometry**
1. **Tabletop:**
   - Start with default cube, scale to 72" × 36" × 1.5"
   - Apply scale (Ctrl+A > Scale)
   - Add Subdivision Surface modifier (2 levels, Simple mode initially)
   - Add Edge Split modifier (prevents unwanted smoothing)

2. **Edge Details:**
   - Select top edges, Bevel (Ctrl+B): 0.125" width, 2 segments, 45° angle
   - Select corner edges, Bevel: 0.5" radius, 8-16 segments for smooth curve
   - Add secondary micro-bevel: 0.03" on sharp edges (prevents unrealistic sharp edges)

3. **Legs:**
   - Add Cylinder: 3" diameter, 28.5" height, 32 vertices (smooth appearance)
   - Rotate 90° (align with Z-axis)
   - Add Simple Deform modifier: Taper mode, 0.0833 factor (3" to 2.75")
   - Limit taper: Empty object controlling start/end points
   - Position at 4" inset from corners

4. **Apron:**
   - Create from cube: 64" × 4" × 0.75" (long apron)
   - Duplicate and scale for short apron: 28" × 4" × 0.75"
   - Add decorative groove: Inset face, Extrude inward 0.0625"
   - Position 0.5" below tabletop underside

5. **Hardware (Optional Detail Level):**
   - Mounting plates: Cube scaled to 4" × 4" × 0.375"
   - Bolt heads: Cylinder, 6-sided, 0.75" across flats
   - Foot pads: Cylinder, 3" diameter × 0.25" height
   - Use Array modifier for bolt patterns

**Phase 2: UV Unwrapping Strategy**

**Tabletop UV Layout:**
- **Method:** Project from view (top view), then scale to square
- **Orientation:** Align UV with grain direction (vertical in UV space)
- **Island:** Single island for entire top surface (seamless grain flow)
- **Edges:** Separate UV island (can use different texture scale)
- **Underside:** Separate island (lower detail acceptable)
- **Texel density:** 512 pixels per foot (2048×1024 texture for 72" × 36" top)
- **Margin:** 0.02 (2% margin between islands)

**Leg UV Layout:**
- **Method:** Cylindrical projection
- **Seam:** Place seam at back of leg (least visible)
- **Unwrap:** U > Unwrap or Cylinder Projection
- **Straighten:** Use Follow Active Quads for straight UV layout
- **Texel density:** Match tabletop (consistent detail level)
- **Orientation:** Vertical in UV space (simplifies texture painting)

**Apron UV Layout:**
- **Method:** Box projection or Smart UV Project
- **Islands:** Separate island per apron piece (allows grain direction control)
- **Orientation:** Horizontal grain in UV space
- **Texel density:** Match tabletop
- **Groove:** May need separate island for proper texturing

**UV Best Practices:**
- **Consistent density:** Use Texel Density Checker addon
- **Minimize stretching:** Check UV > Stretch overlay (blue = good, red = bad)
- **Straighten edges:** Select UV edges, S > X/Y > 0 (straighten)
- **Pack efficiently:** UV > Pack Islands (maximize texture space usage)
- **Non-overlapping:** Ensure no UV overlaps (causes texture errors)

**Phase 3: Material Node Setup**

**Wood Material (Principled BSDF Base):**
```
Base Structure:
- Image Texture (color) → Mix RGB → Base Color
- Noise Texture → ColorRamp → Mix RGB (color variation)
- Wave Texture → ColorRamp → Bump → Normal
- Image Texture (roughness) → Roughness
- Texture Coordinate → Mapping (control scale/rotation)
```

**Detailed Node Tree:**
1. **Color Layer:**
   - Image Texture (wood color map) → Base Color
   - Noise Texture (Scale: 25) → ColorRamp → Mix (Factor: 0.05) → Base Color
   - Purpose: Adds subtle color variation

2. **Bump/Normal Layer:**
   - Image Texture (normal map) → Normal Map node → Normal input
   - Bump node (Distance: 0.015) → Normal input (chain with normal map)
   - Purpose: Creates grain tactile feel

3. **Roughness Layer:**
   - Image Texture (roughness map, B&W) → Roughness (0.4-0.5 range)
   - ColorRamp to adjust contrast
   - Purpose: Varying roughness along grain

4. **Anisotropic Layer:**
   - Anisotropic: 0.3
   - Image Texture (grain direction, B&W) → Anisotropic Rotation
   - Purpose: Elongated reflections following grain

5. **Subsurface Layer:**
   - Subsurface Weight: 0.05-0.08
   - Subsurface Radius: (2.0, 1.5, 1.0)
   - Purpose: Edge translucency

6. **Detail Layers:**
   - Musgrave Texture → ColorRamp → Mix (subtle grain irregularity)
   - Voronoi Texture → ColorRamp → Mix (wood pore simulation)

**Metal Material (Legs):**
```
Simplified Structure:
- Base Color: RGB (25, 25, 25)
- Metallic: 1.0
- Roughness: 0.65 (with noise variation)
- Noise Texture → Bump (orange peel texture)
```

**Detailed Node Tree:**
1. **Base:**
   - RGB node (25, 25, 25) → Base Color
   - Metallic: 1.0
   - Specular: 0.5

2. **Surface Texture:**
   - Noise Texture (Scale: 100, Detail: 3) → Bump (Distance: 0.003)
   - Purpose: Orange peel powder coat texture

3. **Roughness Variation:**
   - Base Roughness: 0.65
   - Noise Texture → ColorRamp → Mix with base roughness (Factor: 0.05)
   - Purpose: Subtle roughness variation

**Phase 4: Texture Creation/Sourcing**

**Option A: Procedural Textures (Fully in Blender)**
- **Advantages:** Infinite resolution, no UV stretching, easy to modify
- **Wood grain:** Wave + Musgrave + Voronoi textures combined
- **Color variation:** Noise + ColorRamp nodes
- **Roughness:** Noise texture mapped to roughness
- **Limitation:** Less realistic than photo textures, requires skill to set up

**Option B: Image Textures (Recommended for Realism)**
- **Source:** Polligon.com, TextureHaven.com, or Poliigon.com
- **Required maps:**
  - Diffuse/Albedo (color): 4K resolution minimum
  - Normal map: 4K (critical for realism)
  - Roughness map: 2K-4K
  - Displacement map (optional): 4K (for extreme close-ups)
- **Wood texture:** Search "white oak" or "oak wood grain"
- **Metal texture:** Search "powder coat black" or create procedurally
- **Seamless:** Ensure textures are seamless or use Box Mapping to hide seams

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (Best Results)**
- Base color from image texture
- Procedural noise for variation
- Image normal map for primary grain
- Procedural bump for micro-detail
- Combines realism of photos with flexibility of procedural

**Phase 5: Detailing with Geometry Nodes (Optional, Advanced)**

**Micro-Detail Generation:**
- **Scratches:** Distribute short curve objects randomly on surface
- **Dust nibs:** Distribute small spheres (0.03" diameter) randomly
- **Grain variation:** Displace surface following procedural texture
- **Advantages:** Non-destructive, adjustable density, art-directable
- **Performance:** Can be heavy, use viewport display settings wisely

**Geometry Nodes Setup Example (Scratches):**
```
1. Distribute Points on Faces (Density: 20-30)
2. Instance on Points (Object: scratch curve)
3. Randomize rotation and scale
4. Set Random (control variation)
5. Join Geometry with main mesh
```

**Phase 6: Particle Systems for Detail (Alternative to Geo Nodes)**

**Dust/Imperfections:**
- Particle system: Hair type
- Count: 50-100 (sparse distribution)
- Render as: Object (tiny sphere or custom shape)
- Randomize: Size, rotation
- Weight paint: Control distribution (more in corners, less in center)

### Modifier Stack Order (Critical for Correct Results):

**Tabletop:**
1. Mirror (if using symmetry workflow)
2. Subdivision Surface (2 levels)
3. Edge Split (prevents unwanted smoothing)
4. Bevel (edge chamfers)
5. Weighted Normal (corrects shading artifacts)

**Legs:**
1. Mirror (if modeling one leg)
2. Array (if duplicating legs)
3. Simple Deform (taper)
4. Subdivision Surface (1-2 levels)
5. Weighted Normal

**General Rules:**
- Deformation modifiers before Subdivision Surface
- Subdivision Surface before detail modifiers (Bevel, etc.)
- Weighted Normal last (fixes shading)

### Shading and Normal Considerations:

**Smooth vs. Flat Shading:**
- **Tabletop:** Smooth shading (organic wood surface)
- **Legs:** Smooth shading (cylindrical form)
- **Apron:** Smooth shading with Edge Split on hard edges
- **Hardware:** Depends on form (smooth for rounded, flat for faceted)

**Auto Smooth:**
- **Enable:** Object Properties > Normals > Auto Smooth
- **Angle:** 30° (prevents smoothing across hard edges)
- **Alternative:** Edge Split modifier (more control)

**Weighted Normal Modifier:**
- **Purpose:** Fixes shading artifacts from bevels and hard edges
- **Settings:** Keep Sharp: ON, Face Influence: OFF
- **Placement:** Last in modifier stack
- **Impact:** Cleaner, more realistic shading

**Custom Normals (Advanced):**
- Edit Mode > Alt+N > Normal Editing tools
- Use for precise control over shading
- Data Transfer modifier can copy normals from high-res mesh

### Camera and Composition:

**Recommended Camera Settings:**
- **Focal Length:** 50mm (natural perspective) or 85mm (compressed, flattering)
- **Sensor Size:** 36mm (full frame)
- **Depth of Field:** Optional, f/4.0-f/5.6 for subtle background blur
- **Focus:** On front edge of tabletop (closest point to camera)
- **Camera Height:** 40-50" (slightly above table, natural viewing angle)
- **Camera Angle:** Slight downward tilt (5-10°) to show tabletop surface

**Composition Guidelines:**
- **Rule of Thirds:** Position table at intersection points
- **Headroom:** Leave space above table (don't crop tight to top)
- **Foreground:** Consider adding foreground element (chair, plant) for depth
- **Background:** Simple, non-competing (wall, window, subtle environment)
- **Lighting Direction:** Key light from side creates dimension and interest

**Multiple Angles for Portfolio:**
1. **Hero shot:** 3/4 view, eye level, shows form and detail
2. **Top-down:** Directly above, shows proportions and symmetry
3. **Detail shot:** Close-up of corner, shows joinery and material detail
4. **In-context:** Table with chairs, place setting (shows scale and use)
5. **Underside:** Shows construction and hardware (technical documentation)

### Render Layers and Passes (for Post-Processing):

**Essential Passes:**
- **Combined:** Full beauty render
- **Diffuse:** Isolate color information
- **Glossy:** Isolate reflections
- **Transmission:** If any (minimal in this scene)
- **Ambient Occlusion:** Contact shadows and crevice darkening
- **Shadow:** Isolate shadows for adjustment
- **Mist:** Depth-based fog (optional for atmosphere)

**Utility Passes:**
- **Normal:** Surface direction (useful for relighting in compositing)
- **Depth/Z:** Distance from camera (for depth of field in post)
- **Object Index:** Isolate specific objects for masking
- **Material Index:** Isolate specific materials
- **Cryptomatte:** Advanced object/material isolation

**Compositing Workflow:**
1. Import render layers into Compositor
2. Adjust AO intensity (multiply over combined)
3. Color grade (RGB Curves, Hue/Saturation)
4. Add subtle vignette (Ellipse Mask + Blur + Mix)
5. Sharpen (Filter node, subtle)
6. Glare (optional, subtle bloom on highlights)
7. Output to file

### Performance Optimization Tips:

**Viewport Performance:**
- **Simplify panel:** Reduce Max Subdivisions in viewport
- **Display as:** Bounds or Wire for high-poly objects during setup
- **Culling:** Enable backface culling (speeds up solid view)
- **HDRI resolution:** Use lower res for viewport (1K), high res for render (8K)
- **Geometry Nodes:** Use viewport display settings (reduce density)

**Render Performance:**
- **Adaptive Sampling:** Enabled, 0.01 threshold (stops when converged)
- **Denoising:** Use GPU denoising (OptiX on NVIDIA, much faster)
- **Light Path Max Bounces:** Start at 8, increase only if needed
- **Caustics:** Disabled (not needed, saves time)
- **Motion Blur:** Disabled (unless animating)
- **Persistent Data:** Enabled (speeds up animation)
- **Tile Size:** Auto or 256×256 for GPU
- **Resolution:** Render at 50-75% for tests, 100% for final

**File Size Management:**
- **Texture resolution:** Use 2K for distant objects, 4K for hero objects
- **Pack textures:** File > External Data > Pack All into .blend
- **Compress .blend:** File > Save As > Compress (reduces file size 50-70%)
- **Purge unused:** File > Clean Up > Purge All (removes unused data blocks)

### Common Pitfalls and Solutions:

**Problem: Shading artifacts (dark streaks)**
- **Solution:** Add Weighted Normal modifier last in stack
- **Alternative:** Enable Auto Smooth with 30° angle
- **Cause:** Bevels and subdivision creating normal conflicts

- **Solution:** Increase light intensity (more light = less noise)
- **Cause:** Insufficient samples or dim lighting

**Problem: Render too dark/bright**
- **Solution:** Adjust exposure in Color Management (±0.5)
- **Solution:** Increase/decrease light intensity
- **Solution:** Check HDRI intensity (0.3-0.5 typical)
