Elements:** Modern roofline with functional parapet hiding mechanicals\n- **Minimal Ornamentation:** Focus on proportion, material quality, and subtle details rather than applied decoration\n- **Horizontal Emphasis:** Window alignment and material transitions create strong horizontal bands\n\n### Scale and Proportion\n\n**Dimensional Relationships:**\nAll proportions follow established architectural principles:\n\n**Golden Ratio Applications:**\n- Front facade width-to-height ratio: approximately 1:1.75 (near golden rectangle)\n- Window proportions: 1:1.25 (ground floor), 1:1.43 (second floor)\n- Entry recess depth to portico height: 1:2.25\n\n**Standard Residential Dimensions:**\n- **Floor Heights:** 9-10 feet (2.74-3.05m) for comfortable ceiling heights and HVAC distribution\n- **Window Head Heights:** Aligned at 7 feet (2.13m) above finished floor for visual continuity\n- **Door Heights:** 8 feet (2.44m) for contemporary proportions and spatial generosity\n- **Step Dimensions:** 7-inch (18cm) rise, 11-inch (28cm) run - optimal for comfortable climbing (complies with 7-11 rule)\n\n**Facade Composition:**\n- **Glazing Ratio:** 20-25% of wall area on primary facades (energy efficient while light-filled)\n- **Solid-to-Void:** Balanced composition with 75-80% solid wall providing structural expression\n- **Vertical Rhythm:** Windows create 3-bay composition on front facade with symmetrical spacing\n- **Material Transition:** Occurs at two-thirds height (23 feet/7m), following rule of thirds\n\n**Human Scale Indicators:**\n- Door hardware at 36 inches (0.91m) - ergonomic reach height\n- Window sills at 30-36 inches (0.76-0.91m) - comfortable viewing height when seated\n- Railing heights at 36-42 inches (0.91-1.07m) - code-compliant safety dimensions\n- Step widths at 5 feet (1.52m) - comfortable for two people side-by-side\n\n### Contextual Urban Features\n\n**Site Relationship:**\n- **Lot Width:** 20 feet (6.1m) - typical urban row house dimension\n- **Lot Depth:** 40 feet (12.2m) - allows 30-foot building with 10-foot rear yard\n- **Front Setback:** 8 feet (2.44m) - minimal to maximize interior space while providing entry sequence\n- **Side Setbacks:** 0 feet - party wall configuration (walls designed to potentially adjoin neighbors)\n- **Rear Setback:** 10 feet (3.05m) - provides private outdoor space and code compliance\n\n**Urban Density Strategies:**\n- **Vertical Organization:** Three floors maximize livable area on constrained footprint\n- **Efficient Circulation:** Compact stair placement (not detailed but space allocated)\n- **Minimal Setbacks:** Building positioned close to property lines\n- **Shared Walls:** Side walls designed as potential party walls (firewall construction)\n\n**Street Interface:**\n- **Sidewalk Connection:** Direct walkway from public sidewalk to entrance\n- **Semi-Private Zone:** 8-foot front yard creates buffer between public and private\n- **Street Presence:** Facade composition designed for pedestrian-scale viewing\n- **Privacy Gradient:** Ground floor windows higher sills (3 feet) for privacy; upper floors lower sills for views\n\n**Neighborhood Context:**\n- **Architectural Compatibility:** Contemporary design that can fit various urban settings\n- **Scale Consistency:** 35-foot height typical for 3-story urban residential\n- **Material Palette:** Brick and modern panels common in transitioning urban neighborhoods\n- **Parking Consideration:** No garage (typical for dense urban areas with street/lot parking)\n\n**Utility Integration:**\n- **Concealed Mechanicals:** Roof equipment hidden by parapet\n- **Side-Mounted Utilities:** Meters and equipment on less-visible side walls\n- **Underground Services:** All utilities enter below grade (electric, water, gas, sewer)\n- **Waste Management:** Space allocated at rear for bins (not modeled)\n\n### Technical Modeling Considerations\n\n**Blender-Specific Guidance:**\n\n**Unit Setup:**\n- Set Blender units to Metric\n- Use 1 Blender unit = 1 meter for accuracy\n- Enable \"Scene Units\" in properties panel\n- Convert all imperial measurements: 1 foot = 0.3048 meters\n\n**Modeling Approach:**\n1. **Foundation and Base:**\n   - Start with cube, scale to foundation dimensions\n   - Extrude upward for walls\n   - Use Array modifier for brick courses\n   - Boolean operations for window and door openings\n\n2. **Wall Construction:**\n   - Model walls as solid volumes (10-inch/25.4cm thickness)\n   - Create separate objects for different materials (brick sections, cement board sections)\n   - Use Edge Split modifier for crisp corners\n   - Apply Bevel modifier (0.5mm) to edges for realism\n\n3. **Windows and Doors:**\n   - Model frames with actual depth (4 inches/10cm)\n   - Glass as separate objects with thickness (0.25 inches/0.6cm)\n   - Use Array modifier for multi-pane windows\n   - Ensure proper clearance for Boolean operations (0.5mm minimum)\n\n4. **Roof Structure:**\n   - Model as separate mesh from walls\n   - Use Solidify modifier for membrane thickness\n   - Create parapet as extruded edge loop\n   - Add Edge Crease for sharp parapet edges\n\n**Boolean Operation Tips:**\n- Always apply scale (Ctrl+A) before Boolean operations\n- Use \"Fast\" solver for simple cuts, \"Exact\" for complex\n- Minimum wall thickness between openings: 12 inches (30.5cm)\n- Add 1mm tolerance to cutting objects to prevent Z-fighting\n\n**Material Assignment:**\n- Use material slots for different surfaces on same object\n- Assign materials in Edit mode by selecting faces\n- Use UV unwrapping for brick texture alignment\n- Apply Box projection for cement board panels\n\n**Texture Mapping:**\n- **Brick:** Use UV Project modifier with camera for correct running bond\n- **Cement Board:** Box mapping with 4×8 foot (1.22×2.44m) texture scale\n- **Windows:** Planar mapping for glass, box for frames\n- **Roof:** Top-down planar projection\n\n**Optimization:**\n- Use instances for repeated elements (windows, bricks in close-ups)\n- Apply modifiers before final render\n- Use Level of Detail (LOD) for distant views\n- Merge vertices by distance (0.1mm threshold) to clean geometry\n\n**Lighting Preparation:**\n- Model interior window reveals (4-inch/10cm depth minimum)\n- Create light-catching surfaces (sills, overhangs)\n- Ensure normals face correctly (Shift+N to recalculate)\n- Add slight surface imperfections for realistic light interaction\n\n**Camera Considerations:**\n- Typical viewing distance: 30-50 feet (9-15m) for exterior shots\n- Eye height: 5.5 feet (1.68m) for pedestrian views\n- Use 35mm focal length for realistic architectural perspective\n- Enable camera DOF with f/5.6 for slight background blur\n\n**Render Settings Recommendations:**\n- Cycles render engine for photorealism\n- Samples: 512-1024 for final renders\n- Light bounces: 8 maximum, 4 minimum\n- Use HDRI environment for realistic lighting\n- Enable Ambient Occlusion in render settings\n\n### Lighting Considerations\n\n**Natural Light Interaction:**\n\n**Facade Shadow Patterns:**\n- **Recessed Entry:** Creates 4-foot deep shadow volume, strongest at midday\n- **Portico Overhang:** Casts 3-foot shadow on facade, varies with sun angle\n- **Window Reveals:** 4-inch depth creates subtle shadow frames around glazing\n- **Parapet Shadow:** Projects 30-inch shadow on upper facade in morning/evening\n\n**Material Light Response:**\n- **Brick:** Diffuse reflection, slight subsurface scattering for depth\n- **Cement Board:** Clean reflections, subtle specularity creates slight sheen\n- **Glass:** Primary light transmission (95%), secondary reflections (40% at angles)\n- **Metal Elements:** Crisp highlights on brushed surfaces, matte absorption on powder-coat\n\n**Time-of-Day Variations:**\n- **Morning (East Light):** Side windows receive direct light, front facade in shadow\n- **Midday (Overhead):** Strong shadows from portico and parapet, high contrast\n- **Afternoon (West Light):** Front facade fully illuminated, long shadows from vertical elements\n- **Evening (Low Angle):** Dramatic raking light emphasizes texture, warm color temperature\n\n**Artificial Lighting:**\n\n**Exterior Fixtures:**\n- **Wall Sconces (flanking door):**\n  - Output: Up and down beams, 90-degree spread\n  - Intensity: 500 lumens equivalent per fixture\n  - Color Temperature: 3000K (warm white)\n  - Effect: Grazing light on brick, illuminated entry\n\n- **Portico LED Strip:**\n  - Output: Downward wash, 120-degree spread\n  - Intensity: 800 lumens equivalent total\n  - Color Temperature: 4000K (neutral white)\n  - Effect: Even illumination of entry area, welcoming glow\n\n- **Step Lighting (optional detail):**\n  - Location: Recessed in step risers\n  - Output: Forward wash on treads\n  - Intensity: 50 lumens per step\n  - Color Temperature: 3000K\n\n**Interior Light Bleed:**\n- Window glow from interior lighting creates depth\n- Warm interior light (2700K) contrasts with exterior\n- Ground floor: 60% light transmission through curtains/blinds\n- Upper floors: 80% transmission (less privacy screening)\n\n**Environmental Lighting:**\n\n**HDRI Setup Recommendations:**\n- **Urban Environment:** City HDRI with buildings for realistic reflections in glass\n- **Time Setting:** Late afternoon (4-6 PM) for warm, dramatic light\n- **Intensity:** 1.0-1.5 for natural brightness\n- **Rotation:** Adjust to place sun at 45-degree angle to front facade\n\n**Supplemental Lighting:**\n- **Sun Lamp:** \n  - Strength: 5.0\n  - Angle: 45 degrees horizontal, 30 degrees vertical\n  - Color Temperature: 5500K (daylight)\n  \n- **Sky Ambient:**\n  - Strength: 0.3-0.5\n  - Color: Slight blue tint RGB (220, 230, 255)\n\n- **Bounce Light (Ground Plane):**\n  - Emission shader on ground: 0.2 strength\n  - Simulates light reflection from pavement/ground\n\n**Atmospheric Effects:**\n- **Volumetric Lighting:** Subtle atmosphere volume (density 0.01) for light shafts through windows\n- **Mist/Fog:** Optional light fog (density 0.005) for depth in wide shots\n- **Glare:** Slight glare on glass reflections for realism (Glare node, threshold 0.8)\n\n**Shadow Quality:**\n- Enable contact shadows for crisp detail near surfaces\n- Use high shadow samples (64+) for smooth penumbra\n- Adjust shadow bias to prevent artifacts on thin geometry\n\n**Reflection Strategy:**\n- **Glass Windows:** Primary environment reflections, capture sky and surrounding buildings\n- **Metal Elements:** Sharp reflections of nearby geometry, use Reflection Planes for efficiency\n- **Glossy Surfaces:** Blurred reflections on cement board and door finish\n\nThis
