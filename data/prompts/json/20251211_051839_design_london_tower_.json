Enhance for cinematic effect while maintaining realism\n- **Color grading:** Post-processing can shift mood (warm/cool, high/low contrast)\n\n### Technical Validation\n- **Real-world references:** Use photographs for texture and detail validation\n- **Measurement verification:** Cross-reference dimensions with architectural drawings\n- **Material authenticity:** Research period-appropriate materials and finishes\n\n### Workflow Efficiency\n- **Start simple:** Block out basic form first, add detail progressively\n- **Test renders:** Frequent low-resolution test renders to validate approach\n- **Modular construction:** Build reusable components (windows, ornament, etc.)\n- **Version control:** Save incremental versions to allow rollback if needed\n\n### Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n- **Over-detailing distant elements:** Focus detail where camera will see it\n- **Uniform weathering:** Real buildings weather unevenly, add variation\n- **Perfect symmetry:** Introduce subtle asymmetries for realism\n- **Ignoring scale:** Ensure all elements are correctly sized relative to each other\n- **Flat lighting:** Use dramatic lighting to reveal form and texture\n\n### Recommended Software and Tools\n- **Primary Modeling:** Blender 3.0+ (free, powerful, comprehensive)\n- **Texture Creation:** Substance Painter, Photoshop, GIMP\n- **Photo Reference:** Google Earth, Wikimedia Commons, architectural databases\n- **Procedural Textures:** Substance Designer, Blender's shader nodes\n- **Rendering:** Cycles (Blender), Eevee for real-time preview\n\nThis refined comprehensive

    "Analysis: ## Analysis of 3D Modeling Request\n\n**Primary Object:** London Tower (Elizabeth Tower/Big Ben)\n\n**Specific Details Mentioned:**\n- Location reference: London\n- Software specified: Blender\n- No specific style, scale, or detail level mentioned\n\n**Overall Complexity:** **High**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The Elizabeth Tower (commonly called Big Ben) is an iconic Gothic Revival structure with intricate architectural details\n- Features include: ornate clock faces, decorative stonework, pointed arches, spires, and complex geometric patterns\n- Requires modeling of multiple components: tower structure, clock mechanism details, roof elements, and ornamental features\n- High polygon count likely needed for architectural accuracy\n- Texturing will require attention to stone materials, metallic clock elements, and weathering effects\n\n**Recommended Approach:**\n1. Start with basic tower geometry (rectangular base with tapering)\n2. Add clock face details and Gothic architectural elements\n3. Model the pyramidal roof and spire\n4. Apply detailed texturing for stone and metal materials\n5. Consider level of detail based on intended use (close-up vs. distant views)",
    "Assessment: NEEDS_EXPANSION (1/6 criteria met)\n\n**Criteria Check:**\n1. ❌ Specific dimensions/sizes - None provided\n2. ❌ Material descriptions - None provided\n3. ❌ Texture details - None provided\n4. ❌ Color specifications - None provided\n5. ❌ Structural components listed - Only \"tower\" mentioned generically\n6. ✅ Surface features/details - Implied by \"London Tower\" (architectural landmark)\n\n**Verdict:** This prompt only provides a basic object name (\"London Tower\") with software specification. While the Elizabeth Tower is a complex structure, the user has not provided ANY specific modeling requirements regarding dimensions, materials, textures, colors, or which structural components to prioritize. This is a simple request that needs significant expansion to be actionable for detailed 3D modeling.",
