Lighting and Rendering Considerations\n\n### **Tabletop Lighting Behavior:**\n\n**Direct Lighting Response:**\n- **Specular Highlights:** Soft, elongated highlights due to satin polyurethane finish\n  - Highlight shape: Stretched and diffused, not pinpoint sharp\n  - Highlight intensity: 20-30% of light source brightness\n  - Falloff: Gradual with soft edges (Gaussian distribution)\n  \n- **Diffuse Reflection:** \n  - Primary lighting response is diffuse scattering\n  - Wood grain becomes more visible and pronounced under direct light\n  - Natural color variation enhanced by directional lighting\n  - Darker areas (knots, heartwood) absorb more light\n  \n- **Subsurface Scattering:** \n  - Visible in thin areas and edges when backlit\n  - Scattering radius: 1.5mm (0.059 inch)\n  - Scattering color: Warm orange-yellow (RGB: R: 220, G: 190, B: 140)\n  - Creates warm glow effect around perimeter when edge-lit\n  - Most prominent on chamfered edges\n\n**Indirect Lighting Response:**\n- **Ambient Occlusion:** \n  - Strong AO in mounting plate recesses (darkening 40-60%)\n  - Subtle AO where tabletop meets legs\n  - Contact shadows in grain pores and knots\n  \n- **Light Bouncing:**\n  - Warm color bounce from wood surface (orange-yellow cast)\n  - Contributes warm ambient light to scene\n  - Underside reflects less light (1-2 stops darker than top)\n  \n- **Shadow Reception:**\n  - Soft shadow edges due to matte surface\n  - Shadows slightly colored by wood tone (warm brown tint)\n  - Edge chamfer creates subtle highlight line along perimeter\n\n**Material Shader Properties (PBR Values):**\n- **Base Color:** Wood texture map (see color specifications in Section 3)\n- **Roughness:** 0.75-0.80 (matte to satin finish)\n- **Specular:** 0.3-0.4 (moderate specular reflection)\n- **Metallic:** 0.0 (non-metallic)\n- **IOR (Index of Refraction):** 1.45 (polyurethane coating)\n- **Sheen:** 0.2-0.3 (subtle fabric-like sheen on wood)\n- **Sheen Tint:** 0.3 (warm sheen color)\n- **Anisotropic:** 0.3 (following wood grain direction)\n- **Anisotropic Rotation:** Aligned with grain direction map\n- **Subsurface:** 0.1-0.2 (subtle SSS effect)\n- **Subsurface Radius:** RGB: (1.5, 1.0, 0.5) mm for realistic color scattering\n- **Subsurface Color:** Warm orange-yellow (RGB: R: 220, G: 190, B: 140)\n\n### **Leg Lighting Behavior:**\n\n**Direct Lighting Response:**\n- **Specular Highlights:** \n  - Very subtle, broad highlights due to matte powder coat\n  - Highlight width: 30-45 degrees around cylinder\n  - Highlight intensity: 5-10% of light source brightness\n  - Soft falloff with no sharp edges\n  \n- **Diffuse Reflection:**\n  - Primary lighting response (90-95% of visible appearance)\n  - Uniform dark appearance from most viewing angles\n  - Slight color shift in highlights (warmer by 5-10 RGB points)\n  - Textured surface creates micro-shadows adding visual interest\n  \n- **Form Definition:**\n  - Cylindrical form revealed through gradual light-to-dark gradient\n  - Decorative groove creates distinct shadow line\n  - Taper at bottom creates subtle highlight on curved transition\n\n**Indirect Lighting Response:**\n- **Ambient Occlusion:**\n  - Strong AO in decorative groove (60-80% darkening)\n  - Contact shadows where leg meets floor (80-90% darkening)\n  - Subtle AO where leg meets tabletop underside\n  \n- **Light Bouncing:**\n  - Minimal light bounce contribution due to dark, matte surface\n  - Absorbs most incident light rather than reflecting\n  - Does not significantly illuminate surrounding surfaces\n  \n- **Shadow Casting:**\n  - Clean, defined shadow edges due to cylindrical form\n  - Shadow sharpness depends on light source size\n  - Groove creates thin secondary shadow line within leg shadow\n\n**Material Shader Properties (PBR Values):**\n- **Base Color:** Charcoal black (RGB: R: 45, G: 45, B: 48)\n- **Roughness:** 0.90-0.95 (very matte)\n- **Specular:** 0.1-0.15 (minimal specular reflection)\n- **Metallic:** 0.0 (non-metallic powder coat)\n- **Normal Map:** Subtle noise for orange-peel texture (0.05-0.1mm bump height)\n- **Bump/Displacement:** Very subtle for micro-surface variation\n\n### **Metal Component Lighting (Mounting Plates & Foot Pads):**\n\n**Direct Lighting Response:**\n- **Anisotropic Reflections:**\n  - Sharp specular highlights along brush direction (radial pattern)\n  - Diffuse reflections perpendicular to brush direction\n  - Creates characteristic \"starburst\" appearance on circular brushed surfaces\n  - Highlight intensity: 60-80% of light source brightness\n  \n- **Fresnel Effect:**\n  - Strong Fresnel at grazing angles (near-perfect reflection)\n  - IOR: 2.5 (stainless steel)\n  - Creates bright rim lighting on edges\n  - Center of surface appears darker when viewed straight-on\n  \n- **Color Response:**\n  - Neutral silver-grey base color\n  - Slight warm shift in highlights (5-10 RGB points warmer)\n  - Reflects environment colors accurately\n\n**Indirect Lighting Response:**\n- **Environment Reflections:**\n  - Clearly reflects surrounding environment (tabletop, room)\n  - Reflections stretched along brush direction\n  - Creates visual connection between table and environment\n  \n- **Ambient Occlusion:**\n  - Subtle AO in mounting plate recesses\n  - Contact shadows where foot pads meet floor\n  - Screw holes create small dark spots\n\n**Material Shader Properties (PBR Values):**\n- **Base Color:** Silver-grey (RGB: R: 192, G: 192, B: 192)\n- **Roughness:** 0.35-0.45 (brushed metal)\n- **Specular:** 0.7-0.8 (high specular reflection)\n- **Metallic:** 1.0 (full metallic)\n- **Anisotropic:** 0.75-0.85 (strong directional reflection)\n- **Anisotropic Rotation:** Radial pattern from center (requires UV mapping)\n- **Normal Map:** Brushed metal texture (linear scratches, 0.01-0.02mm depth)\n- **IOR:** 2.5 (stainless steel -

Model basic geometry with correct proportions\n2. Add fine details (chamfers, grooves, recesses)\n3. Apply modifiers and clean topology\n4. UV unwrap all components\n5. Create and apply materials with proper PBR values\n6. Set up realistic lighting (three-point + HDRI)\n7. Configure camera with appropriate settings\n8. Test render and adjust materials/lighting\n9. Final high-quality render with denoising\n\n**Customization Options:**\n- Adjust dimensions for different table sizes\n- Change wood species (different textures and colors)\n- Modify leg style (tapered, straight, or alternative designs)\n- Add optional features (drawer, shelf, cable management)\n- Create aged/distressed version using wear patterns described\n- Experiment with different color combinations (painted legs, stained top)\n\nThis table design balances aesthetic appeal with practical functionality, making it suitable for architectural visualization, product rendering, interior design presentations, or as a portfolio piece demonstrating advanced 3D modeling and rendering skills.",
